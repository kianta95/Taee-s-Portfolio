# <Git_Into_My_Portfolio>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation is being able to showcase my skills and what I have learned up until the time this assignment was scheduled.
- I built this project to build more knowledge and experience with css and html. I built this portofilio in hopes of being able to use it in the long run with my professional identity.
- Having this portfolio solves the problem of having to keep up with my numerous projects/assignments.
- I learned that I am understanding more than I thought and being able to implement it. I need a lot more practice but I am a little more comfortable. 


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
A GitHub profile with consistently high-quality README files is sure to help you stand out among the crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub, so make sure you give these important files the time and attention they deserve.
